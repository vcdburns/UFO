# UFO

## Overview

The purpose of this was to create a webpage that would filter through UFO sightings and display them in table.  For this challenge it was requested to add to the webpage by adding to the search criteria to return a more in-depth table based on the filtered criteria entered by the user.

## Results

When the page is pulled up it gives you a list of search or filtered criteria that can be used to narrow your search


you then go through and enter in the different criteria that you wish to filter the information for.  Once you've entered your information in the given fields that you want you use you press enter and the matching criteria will be displayed on the screen.  

When you want to do a new search you simply enter in different search criteria or refresh your webpage and re-enter your search criteria.

## Summary

### Drawback

One of the drawbacks to the website's search criteria is that it is that information that you are filtering for must be entered exactly.  So if something is miss spelled for example if it is off by a letter or a space isn't entered between to words or if there is a space at the end no results will be returned.  It doesn't give any margin for error 

### Recommendations

1.  One recommendation would be to allow for a slight miss-spelling of words so results that are close to the desired results would still be displayed.

2.  Another option would be to allow for date ranges to be used in the search criteria.  For example being able to search for information from an entire month, or month and date, or month and year.
